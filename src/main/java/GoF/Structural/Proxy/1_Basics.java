 * (Me: The proxy pattern is essentially like the decorator pattern (in most
 * cases), in that it (usually) implements the same interface as the object it
 * proxies. The difference however is that proxy does not add new behavior,
 * whereas decorator does. Moreover, the pattern resembles adaptor in the sense
 * that it adapts the object for some needs, the difference however is that
 * adaptor changes the interface for a completely new application.)
